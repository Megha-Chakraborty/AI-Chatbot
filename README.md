# Langchain Gemini Chatbot

This project is a chatbot built using Langchain and Google's Gemini model. It leverages Langchain's prompt templates and Googleâ€™s powerful AI model to deliver real-time answers through a Streamlit interface.

## Features
- **Langchain Integration**: The chatbot uses Langchainâ€™s prompt system to generate structured prompts and manage responses via `StrOutputParser`.
- **Google AI (Gemini)**: Utilizes the Gemini model from Google AI Studio for generating conversational responses.
- **Streamlit Interface**: A simple, user-friendly input box for asking any question and displaying responses.
- **Environment Variable Management**: API keys are securely managed using `.env` files, ensuring security and ease of use.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later
- `langchain-google-genai`, `streamlit`, `python-dotenv` libraries
